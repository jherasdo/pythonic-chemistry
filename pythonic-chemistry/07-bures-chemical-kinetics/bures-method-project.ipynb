    "## Application of the Bures method for chemical kinetics\n",
    "The Bures method is a graphical method ([Bures, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201508983), [Nielsen & Bures, Chem. Sci. 2021](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/sc/c8sc04698k)) for the determination of reaction orders, employing only concentration data without the need of computing reaction rates. It relies on the overlap of different concentration curves, and thus it cannot be fully parametrized or automated. Nevertheless, it offers an easy way to determine reaction orders, and it can be easily implemented in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will consider two \"variants\" of the method. The first considers only the order in *catalyst*, which is easier to implement due to the catalyst concentration being constant across the kinetics. The second (also known as the VTNA - Variable Time Normalization Analysis) method is more general, and can be applied to any of the reactants, but it is a bit more complex."

    "Here we have a case with 0.05 M and another with 0.02 M (with the reaction with more catalyst being of course faster).\n",

    "### 2. Application of the more general VTNA \n",
    "Not as straightforward as the previous one, but appliable to any reactant in the process. For each reactant whose order is to be determined, we need at least *two* data series where only the concentration of that reactant X varies, with all other variables being constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Graphical* method: plot the concentrations at different initial loadings against an estimation of the time integral of the concentration of X to the power of *r*. The formula for this is:\n",

However, if the initial concentration of the selected species is not the same in the different experiments, the curves will be shifted. We may displace the curves along the y-axis, but it is simpler to just select a species to plot that is constant: in general, avoid plotting against the species *X* that has been used to compute **Z**.\n",

    "#### Data manipulation\n",
    "The **Z** term requires a few important data transformations from the raw concentration array:\n",
    "1. From time, we need the *intervals* $\\Delta{}t = t_{i} - t_{i-1}$.\n",
    "2. For the target concentrations, we need *rolling averages* that take $c_i$ and $c_{i-1}$, to compute $0.5 (c_i + c_{i-1})$. In Pandas, there is the `.rolling()` method, which provides a *Rolling* object in which we can applicate aggregation functions. \n",
    "3. Then, we compute the product term $\\Delta{}t\\cdot[X]_{avg}^{r}$.\n",
