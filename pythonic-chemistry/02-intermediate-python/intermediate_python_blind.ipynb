    "Now that we already know how to set variables, conditional statements (e.g., if, else) and iterable structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, tuples), it is time to learn control structures like **for** and **while**. In general, control structures enable the programmer to determine the order in which programmatic statements are executed. One of those structures are the **Loops**, which allows you to repeat one or more statements until some **condition** becomes true. Note, that this type of control statement is what makes computers so valuable. A computer can repeatedly execute the same instruction over-and-over again without getting bored with the repetition. \n",

    "Then, we will dive deeper into **best programming practices** introducing how to implement functions in Python. In general, it is a good practice to write functions that are simple and specific for one task. For instances, calculating the mean from a list of values, get the formula of a chemical compound or even opening a csv file.\n",
